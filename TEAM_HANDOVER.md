# Team Handover - Shot by Shot

**Last Updated:** January 6, 2026  
**Status:** 🎬 Active Development - Philosophy Clarification Phase

---

## 🎯 What Is This Project?

**Shot by Shot** (aka "Enjoy Super Time") helps you **film your life** instead of tracking productivity.

### Core Philosophy
- Your day = 6 films (4 hours each)
- Each film has scenes ("shots") you choose to capture
- Timer shows time **flowing**, not running out
- Camera/recording makes mundane moments filmable

**NOT:** A productivity tracker  
**IS:** A life documentation tool

---

## 📱 Current State

### ✅ Working Features
- 12 default "shots" (Coding, Yoga, Write, Loop, Sketch/paint, etc.)
- 4-hour cycle timer (counts down remaining "film")
- Shot-specific timers
- Video recording with audio
- Photo capture
- Life Reel (gallery of captured media)
- 10-minute awareness reminders
- Delete confirmation dialogs
- Settings screen with notification test

### 🔧 Known Issues
- **Philosophy unclear** - Users don't understand "filming life" concept
- **Too many taps** - Takes 4 taps to start filming (should be 1)
- **Notifications feel naggy** - Create anxiety instead of awareness
- **Sound effects don't work** - Haptics partially working

### 🚧 In Progress
- Audio-only recording (planned)
- One-tap camera start (planned)
- Background recording mode (planned)
- Better first-run onboarding (needed)
- Visual redesign with cinema aesthetic (planned)
