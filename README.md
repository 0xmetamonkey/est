# 🎬 Shot by Shot

**Film your life, not your tasks.**

A life documentation app that treats time as cinema. Your day is 6 films (4 hours each), and you're the director choosing what scenes to capture.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xmetamonkey/est.git

flutter pub get
flutter run  # Android phone required
```

## 🎯 What Is This?

Not a productivity app. A **life awareness tool**.

### The Problem
- You want to do many things but forget
- You don't know where time goes
- Life feels boring

### The Solution
**Make time visible. Make life filmable.**

- 12 "shots" (activities) remind you what to film
- 4-hour cycles show time flowing
- Camera/audio captures actual footage
- Life Reel shows what you filmed

When you're "filming" something, even mundane tasks become interesting.

## 🎨 Philosophy

> "We're not building a productivity app. We're building a tool to make time visible and life filmable.  
> Every moment is footage. Every day is cinema. You're the director."

### Not This → Is This
❌ "Complete 10 tasks" → ✅ "You have 4 hours of film left"  
❌ Stress about uncompleted items → ✅ Observe what you chose to film  
❌ Racing against time → ✅ Watching time flow  
❌ Productivity → ✅ **Existence**
