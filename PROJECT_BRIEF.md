# 🎬 Shot by Shot - Project Brief

**Tagline:** Film your life, not your tasks.

---

## The Pitch (30 seconds)

Your day is 6 films. Each film is 4 hours. You're the director.

The app helps you:
- Remember what scenes you want to film
- See time flow (instead of racing against it)
- Capture footage of your existence

It's NOT a productivity app. It's a life documentation tool.

---

## The Problem

**What people say:**
> "I want to do a lot of things, but..."
> - I forget what I wanted to do
> - I don't know what's happening  
> - I'm bored

**Current "solutions" suck:**
- Todo apps = Guilt when unchecked
- Time trackers = Stressful metrics
- Journals = Too much friction

---

## The Solution

**Shot by Shot** makes time visible and turns mundane life into filmable moments.

### How It Works
1. You have **12 "shots"** (activities): Coding, Yoga, Write, etc.
2. Your day is divided into **6x 4-hour "films"**
3. You choose which shots to "film" (aka do)
4. Timer shows **time flowing** (not running out)
5. You can **record actual footage** (video/audio/photos)
6. At the end, you have a **reel** of what you did

### Key Insight
When you're "filming" something, even mundane tasks become interesting. 

You're not "doing yoga." You're **filming a yoga scene**.  
You're not "just coding." You're **capturing footage of your work**.

Life becomes cinema.

## Current Status

### What Works
✅ 12 default activities  
✅ 4-hour cycle timer  
✅ Shot timers  
✅ Video/photo recording  
✅ Gallery ("Life Reel")  
✅ Basic notifications  

### What's Missing
❌ Philosophy isn't clear to users  
❌ Too many taps to start filming  
❌ Audio-only recording  
❌ Background mode  
❌ Better visual metaphor

## Target Users

**Primary:**
- **The Overwhelmed Multi-Hyphenate**
  - Wants to code AND paint AND exercise AND read
  - Forgets what they wanted to do
  - Feels like time disappears

**Secondary:**
- Creative professionals documenting process
- Self-improvement enthusiasts (without productivity pressure)
- People who journal but want less friction

**NOT for:**
- People who want traditional productivity tracking
- People who need team collaboration
- People who want cloud sync / social features

## What Makes This Different?

| Traditional Apps | Shot by Shot |
|-----------------|--------------|
| "Complete 10 tasks today" | "You have 4 hours of film left" |
| Stress about uncompleted items | Observe what you chose to film |
| Metrics, streaks, guilt | Awareness, presence, footage |
| Racing **against** time | Observing time **flow** |
| Productivity | **Existence** |

---

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter (Dart)** - Cross-platform mobile
- **Local-first** - No backend, no sync, no accounts
- **Android primary** - iOS possible but not priority
- **Camera/Audio APIs** - For life documentation

---

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP Refinement (Now)
- Make philosophy crystal clear
- Add audio recording
- One-tap filming
- Better notifications

### Phase 2: Core Experience
- Background mode
- Visual redesign (cinema aesthetic)
- Export/share recordings
- Better Life Reel

### Phase 3: Discovery Features
- Idle time visualization
- Weekly "film festival" (review your week)
- Shot suggestions based on time/mood
- Simple analytics (observational, not judgmental)

---

## Success Metrics

**User retention:**
- Used for 7+ consecutive days

**Behavioral:**
- Actually recorded something (photo/video/audio)
- Created custom shots beyond the 12 defaults

**Qualitative:**
- Says "This makes me aware of my time"
- NOT "I'm more productive"
