## 🎨 Discussion 1: Visual Design - How Should This Look?

**Title:** How should "filming life" look visually?

**Body:**

Right now, Shot by Shot looks like a standard productivity app. But the philosophy is about **filming your life as cinema**.

**Help us design the visual language:**

### Timer Design
Currently: Simple countdown (3:45:23 remaining)

Should it look like:
- A) Film countdown clock (like on a movie set)?
- B) Camera recording indicator?
- C) Film reel spinning?
- D) Something else?

**Share mockups or describe your vision!**

### Overall Aesthetic
What visual metaphors would help communicate "you're filming your life"?

- Film grain overlay?
- Cinema-style UI elements?
- Camera viewfinder aesthetic?
- Director's clapperboard?

### Colors
Keep the calm purple theme or go darker/more cinematic?

**Drop your ideas, sketches, or inspiration!** 🎬

## 💭 Discussion 2: Philosophy - What Does "Filming Life" Mean To You?

**Title:** What does "filming your life" mean to you?

**Body:**

The core concept: **Your life is cinema, and you're the director.**

But what does that actually mean for how you'd use the app?

### Questions:

**1. If you were "filming" your daily activities, what would you capture?**
- Your work process?
- Creative moments?
- Ambient sound?
- Just knowing you "filmed" something?

**2. What makes filming different from just "doing"?**

When you think "I'm filming a coding session" vs "I'm coding" - does it change the experience?

**3. Would you actually record/capture media?**
- Photos every 10 minutes?
- Video clips of interesting moments?
- Audio notes throughout the day?
- Or just the *metaphor* is enough?

**4. How would reviewing your "life reel" feel?**
- Weekly review of captured footage?
- Daily wrap-up?
- Archive for future you?

**Share your interpretation!** This helps us understand if the concept lands. 🎥

## 🔧 Discussion 3: Features - What Would You Actually Use?

**Title:** Which ONE feature would make you use this daily?

**Body:**

We have limited time and want to build what actually matters.

**Vote by emoji and explain why:**

### 🎙️ Audio-Only Recording
Record voice notes, ambient sound, or audio journals without opening camera.

**Use case:** Capture thoughts while writing, or ambient sound during yoga.

---

### ⚡ One-Tap Filming  
Auto-start camera when you begin certain shots (configurable).

**Use case:** Tap "Coding" → Camera opens instantly, no extra taps.

---

### 🌐 Background Mode
Timer + recording continues when app is minimized or screen is locked.

**Use case:** Start recording a walk, put phone in pocket, it keeps going.

---

### 📊 Idle Time Visualization
Show "unfilmed time" (when no shot is running).

**Use case:** Awareness of when you're off-camera vs. in a scene.

---

### 🎬 Better Life Reel
Gallery improvements: filter by shot type, create montages, export clips.

**Use case:** Review your week's footage, share moments.

---

### 🔔 Smarter Reminders
Context-aware notifications ("It's morning - film some yoga?")

**Use case:** Gentle nudges based on time of day or patterns.

---

**Which ONE would make you use this every day?**

React with emoji or comment why. This guides our roadmap!

## ❓ Discussion 4: Open Q&A

**Title:** Questions about Shot by Shot? Ask here!

**Body:**

New to the project? Confused about something? **Ask anything!**

**Common questions:**

**Q: Is this a productivity app?**  
A: No. It's a life awareness/documentation tool. The goal is observing time, not maximizing output.

**Q: Why 4-hour cycles?**  
A: It's core to the cinema metaphor (6 films per day). Makes time feel more manageable than a 24-hour view.

**Q: Can I use it without filming?**  
A: Yes! The timer alone makes time visible. Filming is optional but central to the concept.

**Q: Does it work on iOS?**  
A: Not yet. Android only for now.
